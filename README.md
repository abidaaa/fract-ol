# Fract'ol
This project helped me hone my skills when it comes to computer graphics, and made me 
discover/use the mathematical notion of complex numbers and to take a peek at the concept
of optimization in computer graphics.

### What is Fract'ol?
The term fractal was first used by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1974,
he based it on the Latin word fractus, meaning "broken" or "fractured".
A fractal is an abstract mathematical object, like a curve or a surface, which has a similar
pattern whatever the scale.
This projectâ€™s goal is to create a small fractal exploration program.
Here is some examples :
